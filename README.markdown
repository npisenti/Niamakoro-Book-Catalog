# Niamakoro Education Project

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to establish libraries and through community-driven collaboration 
improve the educational outlook of the children of Niamakoro, providing them with 
additional resources and encouraging innovation and creative thinking.

## Project History

The Niamakoro Education Project started out of the joint vision of Sarah Smilkstein, 
an American student at Scripps College who spent a semester of her junior year abroad 
in Mali, and Moussa “Balla” Coulibaly, a Malian law student she met during her time 
there. Together they envisioned bringing a library with a variety of outreach services 
to Niamakoro to support the neighborhood's educational ambitions. Following her graduation 
from Scripps in 2011, Sarah returned to Mali with her fiancé, Neal Pisenti, to launch 
the project. Moussa had since left the country for an internship in Europe, but Sarah and 
Neal teamed up with Robert Berthé, Youssouf "Baïssou" Coulibaly, and Mamadou "Voldo" Coulibaly 
to get the project off the ground. 

Robert, Baïssou and Voldo all grew up in Niamakoro and began their education at the schools 
where we work. They will become the project's first librarians, in addition to their role 
steering the project. Robert, Baïssou, and Voldo are part of a large group of young, educated 
Malians who have found themselves without jobs. The Niamakoro Education Project seeks to 
engage community members in improving education in their community while offering additional 
economic opportunities and keeping the benefits of those opportunities in the community.

# This book catalog.

This code is for a book catalog ("fiche") for use at the library. I've (perhaps unwisely) skipped
putting together a testing framework, etc. for this due to lack of time and intermitten internet
access (which I've realized makes coding so much harder!). However, I've tried to test things manually, 
and I'm about to release it into the wild. Hopefully any bugs will show up before we leave Mali.
